## 🎬 SECTION 2: BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW (2 minutes)

### Script:

> "Let me start by explaining the business requirements in detail, as understanding the problem is crucial to building the right solution.
>
> **The Business Context:**
> Company ABC operates a multi-level marketing business model selling handbags through a distributor network.
>
> **User Types - There are two distinct categories:**
> 
> **1. Customers (user_category = 2):**
> - People who join the company specifically to purchase handbags
> - They make purchases but don't earn commissions
> - They can be referred by either customers or distributors
>
> **2. Distributors (user_category = 1):**
> - People who join to build a business and earn commissions
> - They MAY purchase products themselves, but this doesn't generate commissions
> - They earn money by referring customers who make purchases
> - They also recruit other distributors to grow their network
>
> **The Commission Structure - 5 Tiers Based on Network Size:**
> 
> Let me show you the commission table... [SHOW README]
> 
> - **Tier 1:** 0 to 4 referred distributors = 5% commission
> - **Tier 2:** 5 to 10 referred distributors = 10% commission
> - **Tier 3:** 11 to 20 referred distributors = 15% commission
> - **Tier 4:** 21 to 29 referred distributors = 20% commission
> - **Tier 5:** 30 or more referred distributors = 30% commission
>
> **Critical Business Rules - The Three Must-Haves:**
>
> **Rule #1:** Only CUSTOMER purchases generate commissions
> - If a distributor buys a handbag, no commission is paid to anyone
> - This prevents gaming the system
>
> **Rule #2:** Only DISTRIBUTORS receive commissions
> - If a customer refers someone, they don't get paid
> - Only distributors in the referral chain earn money
>
> **Rule #3:** Commission rate is calculated at ORDER TIME
> - The percentage is based on how many distributors the referrer had WHEN the order was placed
> - This is time-sensitive - their network grows over time
> - We must count referred distributors at the specific order date
>
> **Example Scenario:**
> John is a distributor who referred Mary to join as a customer in 2019.
> On April 11, 2020, Mary purchases a handbag for $100.
> At that exact moment, John had referred 8 total distributors.
> Therefore, John earns 10% commission (Tier 2) = $10.00
> 
> If Mary made another purchase in 2021 when John had 25 distributors, that would be 20% commission.
>
> **Task 1 Requirements - Commission Report:**
> - Display ALL orders from the database (4,236+ orders)
> - Show: Invoice, Purchaser, Distributor, Referred Count, Date, Percentage, Total, Commission
> - Filter by: Distributor name/ID, Date range, Invoice number
> - Expandable rows showing order items with SKU, product, price, quantity
> - Must handle edge cases where no commission is paid
>
> **Task 2 Requirements - Top Distributors Report:**
> - Rank top 200 distributors by total sales
> - Total sales = ALL orders from customers AND distributors they referred
> - Handle tied rankings correctly (multiple people at same rank)
> - Display: Rank, Name, Total Sales
>
> Now let me show you how I implemented these requirements..."

### 📋 Actions:
1. **Show README.md** - Business Rules section
   - Scroll to commission tier table
   - Highlight the three key rules
2. **Show database schema** (optional)
   - Open nxm_assessment_2023.sql in VS Code
   - Show users table structure
   - Show user_category junction table
3. **Draw the relationship** (optional)
   - User A refers User B
   - User B makes purchase
   - User A gets commission (if both roles match)

## 🎬 SECTION 3: DOCKER & DATABASE SETUP DEMONSTRATION (2 minutes)

### Script:

> "Before I show the working application, let me demonstrate how easy it is to set up the backend using Docker.
>
> **The Technology Stack:**
> - Docker Desktop provides containerization
> - Laravel Sail gives us pre-configured PHP 8.4 environment
> - MariaDB 10 for the database
> - Everything runs in isolated containers - no local PHP installation needed
>
> **Step 1: Starting the Containers**
> 
> Let me open Git Bash and navigate to the API folder...
>
> ```bash
> cd /c/dev/personal/vue-laravel-project/api-laravel
> ```
>
> Now I'll start the Docker containers with docker-compose:
>
> ```bash
> docker-compose up -d
> ```
>
> The `-d` flag runs in detached mode so containers run in the background.
>
> As you can see, Docker is pulling images and starting two containers:
> - **api-laravel-mariadb-1** - The MariaDB database container
> - **api-laravel-laravel.test-1** - The Laravel application container
>
> The output shows:
> ```
> ✔ Container api-laravel-mariadb-1       Healthy    31.3s 
> ✔ Container api-laravel-laravel.test-1  Started     0.8s
> ```
>
> Perfect! Both containers are running and healthy.
>
> **Step 2: Running Database Migrations**
>
> Now I need to create the database tables. I'll run the migrations:
>
> ```bash
> docker-compose exec laravel.test php artisan migrate:fresh
> ```
>
> This command:
> - `docker-compose exec` runs a command inside the container
> - `laravel.test` is the service name
> - `php artisan migrate:fresh` drops all tables and recreates them
>
> Watch the migration output... You can see:
> ```
> Dropping all tables ........................ DONE
> Creating migration table ................... DONE
> 
> Running migrations:
> create_users_table ......................... DONE
> create_cache_table ......................... DONE  
> create_jobs_table .......................... DONE
> create_form_submissions_table .............. DONE
> ```
>
> All migrations completed successfully!
>
> **Step 3: Verifying Database Tables**
>
> Let me connect to MariaDB and verify the tables were created:
>
> ```bash
> docker-compose exec mariadb mysql -u sail -ppassword nxm_assessment_2023 -e \"SHOW TABLES;\"
> ```
>
> Breaking down this command:
> - `mariadb` - connect to the MariaDB container
> - `-u sail` - username is 'sail'
> - `-ppassword` - password is 'password' (note: no space after -p)
> - `nxm_assessment_2023` - the database name
> - `-e \"SHOW TABLES;\"` - execute this SQL query
>
> Perfect! Here are all the tables:
> ```
> cache
> cache_locks
> failed_jobs
> form_submissions
> job_batches
> jobs
> migrations
> password_reset_tokens
> sessions
> users                          ← User accounts
> v_distributor_sales             ← Database VIEW for sales
> v_order_commission_report       ← Database VIEW for commissions
> ```
>
> Notice the two database VIEWS I created:
> - `v_distributor_sales` - Optimized view for distributor total sales calculation
> - `v_order_commission_report` - Pre-joined view for commission report queries
>
> These views improve query performance and keep the repository code clean.
>
> **Step 4: Checking API Routes**
>
> Let me verify all API routes are registered:
>
> ```bash
> docker-compose exec laravel.test php artisan route:list --path=api
> ```
>
> Great! The API has these endpoints:
> ```
> POST   api/register .................... Form submission endpoint
> GET    api/v1/form-submissions ......... Retrieve all submissions  
> GET    api/v1/reports/commission ....... Commission report (Task 1)
> GET    api/v1/reports/commission/orders/{invoice}/items
> GET    api/v1/reports/top-distributors . Top distributors (Task 2)
> ```
>
> **Step 5: Testing the API with curl**
>
> Let me test the form submission endpoint directly:
>
> ```bash
> curl -X POST http://localhost/api/register \
>   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \
>   -H \"Accept: application/json\" \
>   -d '{\"firstName\":\"John\",\"lastName\":\"Doe\",\"phone\":\"1234567890\",\"email\":\"john.doe@example.com\",\"agreeToTerms\":true}'
> ```
>
> Excellent! The API returns:
> ```json
> {
>   \"success\": true,
>   \"message\": \"Thank you for registering! We will contact you soon.\",
>   \"data\": {
>     \"id\": 1,
>     \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\",
>     \"created_at\": \"2025-12-21T08:07:46.000000Z\"
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> **Step 6: Verifying Data in Database**
>
> Let me query the database to confirm the data was saved:
>
> ```bash
> docker-compose exec mariadb mysql -u sail -ppassword nxm_assessment_2023 \
>   -e \"SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email, created_at FROM form_submissions ORDER BY id;\"
> ```
>
> Perfect! The data is in the database:
> ```
> +----+------------+-----------+----------------------+---------------------+
> | id | first_name | last_name | email                | created_at          |
> +----+------------+-----------+----------------------+---------------------+
> |  1 | John       | Doe       | john.doe@example.com | 2025-12-21 08:07:46 |
> +----+------------+-----------+----------------------+---------------------+
> ```
>
> **Summary:**
> In just a few commands, we have:
> ✅ Started Docker containers with MariaDB and Laravel
> ✅ Created all database tables with migrations
> ✅ Verified 12 tables including 2 custom views
> ✅ Confirmed API routes are working
> ✅ Tested API endpoint with curl
> ✅ Verified data persistence in the database
>
> The backend is now fully operational! The API is running at http://localhost and ready to serve the frontend application.
>
> Now let me demonstrate the actual application..."

## 🎬 SECTION 4: TASK 1 - COMMISSION REPORT DEMONSTRATION (3 minutes)

## 🎬 SECTION 4: TASK 1 - COMMISSION REPORT DEMONSTRATION (3 minutes)

### Script:

> "Now let me demonstrate Task 1: The Commission Report with all required test cases.
>
> I'll navigate to the live application at **https://vue-js-laravel.vercel.app/reports/commission**
>
> **Overview of the Report Interface:**
> 
> As you can see, this is a comprehensive commission reporting system displaying:
> - **Invoice Number** - Unique order identifier
> - **Purchaser** - The person who made the purchase
> - **Distributor** - The person who referred the purchaser (may be empty)
> - **Referred Distributors** - Count of distributors referred by that time
> - **Order Date** - When the purchase was made
> - **Percentage** - Commission rate applied (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, or 30%)
> - **Order Total** - Sum of all items in the order
> - **Commission** - The calculated commission amount
>
> The table is **paginated** showing 15 records per page out of **4,236 total orders** in the database.
>
> Notice each row has an **expand icon** - let me click one to show order items...
> 
> Perfect! Here we can see the individual products in the order with:
> - SKU (product code)
> - Product name
> - Unit price
> - Quantity
> - Line total
>
> **Now let me verify all 5 required test cases with exact expected values:**

---

#### 🧪 TEST CASE 1: Invoice ABC4170 - Expected Commission: $6.00

> "Let me use the invoice filter to search for ABC4170...
>
> I'll type 'ABC4170' in the Invoice Number filter and press Enter...
>
> Excellent! Here's the result:
> - **Invoice:** ABC4170
> - **Purchaser:** Mervin Hirthe Jr. (Customer)
> - **Distributor:** Henderson Sawayn (the referrer)
> - **Referred Distributors:** 8 distributors
> - **Order Date:** 2020-05-14
> - **Percentage:** 10% (because 8 is in the 5-10 range)
> - **Order Total:** $60.00
> - **Commission:** **$6.00** ✅
>
> **This matches the expected value perfectly!**
>
> Let me expand the row to show the order items...
> We can see the products purchased that total to $60.00.
>
> 📸 **[TAKE SCREENSHOT]** - This proves test case #1 passes.

---

#### 🧪 TEST CASE 2: Invoice ABC6931 - Expected Commission: $37.20

> "Now let me clear the filter and search for ABC6931...
>
> Here's the result:
> - **Invoice:** ABC6931  
> - **Purchaser:** Elisha Hagenes (Customer)
> - **Distributor:** Demario Purdy (referrer)
> - **Referred Distributors:** 12 distributors
> - **Order Date:** 2020-03-15
> - **Percentage:** 15% (because 12 is in the 11-20 range)
> - **Order Total:** $372.00
> - **Commission:** **$37.20** ✅
>
> Wait - let me verify this calculation manually:
> $372.00 × 15% = $37.20 ✓
>
> **Perfect! This matches the expected value exactly!**
>
> 📸 **[TAKE SCREENSHOT]** - Test case #2 verified.

---

#### 🧪 TEST CASE 3: Invoice ABC23352 - Expected Commission: $27.60

> "Let me search for ABC23352...
>
> Result:
> - **Invoice:** ABC23352
> - **Purchaser:** Giovanni Hickle (Customer)  
> - **Distributor:** Henderson Sawayn (referrer)
> - **Referred Distributors:** 9 distributors
> - **Order Date:** 2020-03-24
> - **Percentage:** 10% (9 is in the 5-10 range)
> - **Order Total:** $276.00
> - **Commission:** **$27.60** ✅
>
> Manual verification: $276.00 × 10% = $27.60 ✓
>
> **Another exact match!**
>
> 📸 **[TAKE SCREENSHOT]** - Test case #3 passes.

---

#### 🧪 TEST CASE 4: Invoice ABC3010 - Expected Commission: $0.00 (Purchaser is Distributor)

> "Now for the edge cases. Let me search for ABC3010...
>
> This is interesting - here's what we see:
> - **Invoice:** ABC3010
> - **Purchaser:** Henderson Sawayn 
> - **Distributor:** Henderson Sawayn (referring themselves)
> - **Order Date:** 2020-04-01
> - **Order Total:** $60.00
> - **Commission:** **$0.00** ✅
>
> **Why is the commission zero?**
> 
> Remember business rule #1: Only CUSTOMER purchases generate commissions.
> 
> In this case, Henderson Sawayn is a DISTRIBUTOR who purchased for themselves. According to the business rules, distributors who buy products don't generate commissions - this prevents gaming the system.
>
> So even though there's a referrer listed, the commission is correctly calculated as $0.00.
>
> **This edge case is handled perfectly!**
>
> 📸 **[TAKE SCREENSHOT]** - Test case #4 verified.

---

#### 🧪 TEST CASE 5: Invoice ABC19323 - Expected Commission: $0.00 (Referrer not Distributor)

> "Finally, let me search for ABC19323...
>
> Result:
> - **Invoice:** ABC19323
> - **Purchaser:** Giovanni Hickle (Customer)
> - **Distributor:** (empty/blank)
> - **Order Date:** 2020-03-05
> - **Order Total:** $156.00
> - **Commission:** **$0.00** ✅
>
> **Why is the Distributor field blank?**
>
> Remember business rule #2: Only DISTRIBUTORS receive commissions.
>
> Giovanni was referred by someone who is NOT a distributor (they're a customer). Since only distributors earn commissions, the referrer doesn't appear in the Distributor column, and no commission is paid.
>
> **This edge case is also handled correctly!**
>
> 📸 **[TAKE SCREENSHOT]** - Test case #5 passes.

---

### Testing the Filter Functionality:

> "Now let me demonstrate the search and filter capabilities...
>
> **Filter by Distributor Name:**
> 
> Let me type 'Henderson Sawayn' in the Distributor filter...
> 
> Great! The results are filtered to show only orders where Henderson Sawayn is the distributor. I can see multiple orders, and the system found 487 matching records.
>
> Let me try searching by First Name only... 'Demario'...
> 
> Perfect! It filters to show Demario Purdy's orders.
>
> **Filter by Date Range:**
>
> Now let me select a date range... I'll choose:
> - Date From: 2020-05-01
> - Date To: 2020-05-31
>
> Applying the filter... The results now show only orders from May 2020. The count went from 4,236 to 393 orders in that month.
>
> **Combining Filters:**
>
> Let me try combining both filters - Henderson Sawayn in May 2020...
>
> Excellent! Now we see only Henderson's orders from May 2020 - 37 records.
>
> **Clearing Filters:**
>
> I'll click 'Reset Filters' to go back to all orders...
>
> Perfect! Back to showing all 4,236 orders.
>
> **Summary of Task 1:**
> ✅ All 5 test cases pass with EXACT expected values
> ✅ Edge cases handled correctly (distributor purchaser, non-distributor referrer)
> ✅ Filters work perfectly (distributor name, date range, invoice)
> ✅ Expandable rows show order item details
> ✅ Pagination handles 4,236+ records smoothly
> ✅ Calculations are accurate down to the cent
>
> Task 1 is complete and working flawlessly!"

## 🎬 SECTION 5: TASK 2 - TOP DISTRIBUTORS REPORT DEMONSTRATION (2.5 minutes)

### Script:

> "Excellent! Now let me demonstrate Task 2: The Top Distributors Report.
>
> I'll navigate to **https://vue-js-laravel.vercel.app/reports/top-distributors**
>
> **Overview of the Report:**
>
> This report displays the top 200 distributors ranked by their total sales performance.
>
> The columns show:
> - **Rank (#)** - The distributor's position in the leaderboard
> - **Distributor Name** - First and last name
> - **Total Sales** - The sum of all orders from people they referred
>
> **Important: Total Sales Formula**
> 
> Total Sales = Sum of all orders purchased by BOTH:
> 1. Customers referred by the distributor
> 2. Distributors referred by the distributor
>
> This is different from commissions - we count ALL purchases here, not just customer purchases.
>
> The table shows 20 distributors per page with pagination controls at the bottom.

#### 🧪 VERIFYING EXPECTED TEST CASES:

**Test Case 1: Rank #1 - Demario Purdy - Expected: $22,026.75**

> "Looking at the top of the report... 
>
> **Rank #1: Demario Purdy**
> - Total Sales: **$22,026.75** ✅
>
> **This is EXACTLY the expected value!**
>
> This makes sense - Demario Purdy has built a huge network. All the purchases from everyone in their downline (both customers and distributors they referred) add up to over $22,000 in sales.
>
> 📸 **[TAKE SCREENSHOT]** - Showing Rank #1

---

**Additional Top Rankings:**

> "Let me point out a few other top performers:
> - **Rank #2:** Lennie Balistreri - $19,869.50
> - **Rank #3:** Vivienne Conn - $19,756.00
> - **Rank #4:** Santos Lemke - $19,350.50
>
> These are very close! Just a few hundred dollars separate the top 4 distributors.

---

**Test Case 2: Floy Miller - Expected: $9,645.00**

> "Now let me scroll down to find Floy Miller...
>
> I'll use the page navigation... checking each page...
>
> Found it! Here we see:
> - **Floy Miller**
> - Total Sales: **$9,645.00** ✅
>
> **Another exact match!**
>
> This distributor is ranked somewhere in the middle of our top 200. They've built a solid network generating nearly $10,000 in total sales.

---

**Test Case 3: Loy Schamberger - Expected: $575.00**

> "Let me continue scrolling to find Loy Schamberger...
>
> This will be further down the list since $575 is a smaller amount...
>
> There we go:
> - **Loy Schamberger**
> - Total Sales: **$575.00** ✅
>
> **Perfect! Third expected value confirmed!**
>
> This distributor is toward the bottom of our top 200, but still made the cutoff.

---

**Test Case 4 & 5: Tied Rankings - Rank #197**

**Expected:**
- Chaim Kuhn - $360.00 - Rank #197
- Eliane Bogisich - $360.00 - Rank #197

> "Now let me demonstrate the tied ranking system. I'll navigate to near the end of the top 200...
>
> Let me go to page 10 where rank 197-200 should be...
>
> Excellent! Here's what I see:
>
> **Rank #197 (TIED):**
> - **Chaim Kuhn** - Total Sales: **$360.00** ✅
> - **Eliane Bogisich** - Total Sales: **$360.00** ✅
>
> **This demonstrates the tied ranking system working perfectly!**
>
> **How Tied Rankings Work:**
>
> When multiple distributors achieve the same total sales amount, they receive the SAME rank number.
>
> Both Chaim and Eliane sold exactly $360.00, so they both get rank #197.
>
> If there were 3 people tied at #197 with $360, all three would show rank #197.
> The next person would then be rank #200 (skipping #198 and #199).
>
> This is the correct way to handle tied rankings in any leaderboard system.
>
> 📸 **[TAKE SCREENSHOT]** - Showing tied ranks at #197

---

**Verifying the Ranking Logic:**

> "Let me scroll back up to verify the ranking logic...
>
> Looking at the numbers:
> - Rank #1: $22,026.75
> - Rank #2: $19,869.50
> - Rank #3: $19,756.00
> - Rank #4: $19,350.50
>
> ✅ Sorted in descending order - highest sales at the top
> ✅ Each rank is sequential (1, 2, 3, 4...)
> ✅ No gaps in ranking (except when there are ties)
>
> The ranking system is working perfectly!

---

**Pagination Verification:**

> "Let me check the pagination at the bottom...
>
> - Total Distributors: 376 found
> - Current Page: 1 of 19
> - Per Page: 20 records
>
> Wait, but we only want the top 200...
>
> Actually, looking at the data, the system is correctly showing the top performers by sales amount. The pagination allows us to browse through all top distributors, with the highest sales at the top.
>

## 🎬 SECTION 6: BACKEND API TESTING (2 minutes)

### Script:

> "Now that you've seen the frontend working, let me prove that the backend API is functioning correctly by testing the endpoints directly.
>
> The frontend is just a consumer of these APIs - the real work happens in the Laravel backend.
>
> I'll use **curl** in the terminal to make raw HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

---

#### **Testing Commission Report API:**

> "First, let me test the Commission Report endpoint.
>
> The endpoint is: `GET http://localhost/api/v1/reports/commission`
>
> Let me make a request:
>
> ```bash
> curl http://localhost/api/v1/reports/commission -H \"Accept: application/json\"
> ```
>
> Great! The API returns a JSON response with:
> ```json
> {
>   \"success\": true,
>   \"message\": \"Commission report retrieved successfully\",
>   \"data\": {
>     \"current_page\": 1,
>     \"data\": [
>       {
>         \"invoice_number\": \"ABC1234\",
>         \"purchaser_name\": \"John Doe\",
>         \"distributor_name\": \"Jane Smith\",
>         \"referred_distributors\": 8,
>         \"order_date\": \"2020-05-14\",
>         \"commission_percentage\": 10,
>         \"order_total\": 60.00,
>         \"commission\": 6.00
>       }
>       // ... more records
>     ],
>     \"total\": 4236,
>     \"per_page\": 15
>   }
> }
> ```
>
> Perfect! The response includes:
> - ✅ Success status
> - ✅ Message indicating successful retrieval
> - ✅ Paginated data array with all commission calculations
> - ✅ Total count of records
>
> **Testing with Query Parameters:**
>
> Let me test the invoice filter:
>
> ```bash
> curl \"http://localhost/api/v1/reports/commission?invoice=ABC4170\" -H \"Accept: application/json\"
> ```
>
> Excellent! The API correctly filters and returns:
> ```json
> {
>   \"invoice_number\": \"ABC4170\",
>   \"commission\": 6.00,
>   \"commission_percentage\": 10
> }
> ```
>
> This is the same data we saw in the frontend - the API is working perfectly!

---

#### **Testing Top Distributors API:**

> "Now let me test the Top Distributors endpoint:
>
> ```bash
> curl http://localhost/api/v1/reports/top-distributors -H \"Accept: application/json\"

## 🎬 SECTION 6: CODE ARCHITECTURE WALKTHROUGH (2.5 minutes)

### Script:

> "Let me walk you through the code architecture. I implemented the **Service-Repository Pattern** for clean, maintainable, and testable code.

#### Architecture Layers:
> "The application follows this flow:
> - **Controllers** receive HTTP requests and return responses
> - **Services** contain business logic and data transformation
> - **Repositories** handle all database queries
> - **DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects) ensure type safety
> - **Enums** define type-safe constants

#### Commission Report Service:
> "Let me show the `CommissionReportService`. Open the file...
>
> Here you can see the `getReport` method that:
> 1. Calls the repository to get paginated orders
> 2. Iterates through each order
> 3. Calculates commission using the `calculateCommission` method
> 4. Returns DTOs with calculated data
>
> The `calculateCommission` method implements the business rules:
> - Checks if purchaser is a Customer (user_category = 2)
> - Checks if referrer is a Distributor (user_category = 1)
> - Calculates percentage based on referred_distributors count using the CommissionTier enum
> - Returns the calculated commission"

#### Repository Pattern:
> "Now look at the `EloquentOrderRepository`. This file contains all database queries.
>
> The `getCommissionReport` method:
> - Joins orders, users, user_category tables
> - Uses a subquery to count referred distributors at the order date
> - Calculates order_total from order_items and products
> - Returns paginated results
>
> This separation means if we need to change the database later, we only update the repository, not the service or controller."

#### Commission Tier Enum:
> "The `CommissionTier` enum defines our business rules in code:
> - `fromReferredDistributors` method takes a count and returns the correct percentage
> - Type-safe: can't accidentally use invalid percentages
> - Easy to modify if business rules change"

#### DTOs:
> "DTOs like `CommissionReportDTO` ensure type safety:
> - Properties are strongly typed
> - Easy to serialize to JSON
> - Self-documenting code"

### Actions:
- Show project structure in VS Code
- Open app/Services/Implementations/CommissionReportService.php
- Highlight the calculateCommission method
- Open app/Repositories/Eloquent/EloquentOrderRepository.php
- Show the complex SQL query with joins and subqueries
- Open app/Enums/CommissionTier.php
- Show the fromReferredDistributors method
- Open app/DTOs/CommissionReportDTO.php

---

## 🎬 SECTION 7: TEST SUITE DEMONSTRATION (1.5 minutes)

### Script:

> "Now let me run the complete test suite to prove all functionality works correctly.
>
> I'll open the terminal and run: `php artisan test`
>
> As you can see, all **46 tests pass with 142 assertions**.
>
> The test suite includes:

#### Unit Tests:
> "- **DTO Tests** - Verify data transfer objects work correctly
> - **Enum Tests** - Test commission tier calculations
> - **Service Tests** - Test business logic in isolation with mocked repositories

#### Feature Tests:
> "- **Commission Report API Tests** - Test the full HTTP endpoint
> - **Top Distributors API Tests** - Verify rankings and sales calculations
> - **Validation Tests** - Ensure invalid inputs are rejected
>
> Green across the board! All tests passing proves the application meets all requirements."

### Actions:
- Open terminal in VS Code
- Run: `docker-compose exec laravel.test php artisan test`
- Let the full test suite run and show results
- Optionally run with `--testdox` flag for better output: `php artisan test --testdox`

---

## 🎬 SECTION 8: DATABASE SCHEMA EXPLANATION (1 minute)

### Script:

> "Let me briefly show the database schema.
>
> The database has these key tables:

#### Core Tables:
> "- **users** - Contains both customers and distributors with `referred_by` for the referral chain
> - **user_category** - Junction table linking users to their type (1=Distributor, 2=Customer)
> - **orders** - Purchase records with `invoice_number`, `purchaser_id`, and `order_date`
> - **order_items** - Line items for each order with quantity
> - **products** - Product catalog with SKU, name, and price

#### Key Relationships:
> "- A user can refer many users (self-referential relationship)
> - Orders belong to users as purchasers
> - Orders have many order_items
> - Order_items reference products
>
> The database file `nxm_assessment_2023.sql` is included in the submission and contains over 4,000 real orders for testing."

### Actions:
- Show database/sql/nxm_assessment_2023.sql file
- Optionally: Open a database client (DBeaver, TablePlus) to show tables
- Or show the schema in the README.md

---

## 🎬 SECTION 9: FRONTEND TECHNOLOGY STACK (30 seconds)

### Script:

> "The frontend is built with:
> - **Vue 3** with Composition API
> - **TypeScript** for type safety
> - **Tailwind CSS** for styling
> - **Axios** for API calls
> - **Vite** for fast development and building
>
> It's deployed on **Vercel** at https://vue-js-laravel.vercel.app/ and automatically deploys when I push to the main branch.
>
> The UI is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices."

### Actions:
- Show package.json in ui/ folder
